1. Domain matching : exactly the same as step 4 : only added the multiplication
Expressiveness : Same
Scalability : WAYÂ easier : just code some small state machines, and multiply them

2. Cost of a new feature : code the feature with a state machine, and multiply
to the previous model

3. Scalability of the model paradygme : way harder to change how the model works because you must write all the model objetcs, rewrite the Java-C compiler, etc...
